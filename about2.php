<p style="color:black; text-align: center; text-transform: capitalize">At India, our passion is to connect our guests to the very best of our destinations. From the beaches of Hawaii and Bermuda to the deserts of the United Arab Emirates to the heart of London, our hotels offer guests extraordinary places, created by combining unique architecture and structure, expressive decor and artistry, and magnificent features. Add great service, and the result is an unforgettable guest experience.<br>

We’re proud to welcome you to our collection, which includes some of the most iconic hotels in the world, including The Plaza in New York, The Savoy in London, Fairmont Peace Hotel in Shanghai and Fairmont Le Château Frontenac in Québec City. We invite you to think of these, or any of our 70 hotels around the world, as your home base for all of your adventures.<br>

Many of our hotels were among the first buildings to be erected in young cities across North America; in these places, we can boast that our communities literally grew up around us. Today, we have added many modern city-center properties to our collection, with core locations from Barcelona to Beijing that allow you to join the bustle of the city and enjoy the culture, flavors and sounds of local life. <br>

And, if urban excitement isn’t on your itinerary, our resorts welcome you to some of the most breathtaking and pristine areas in the world, where you can bask on an inviting beach, challenge yourself on a stunning golf course and feel the rush of fresh powder on an exhilarating ski hill.<br>

While we aim to give you an authentic experience of the locale whenever you stay with us, we also guarantee consistent high standards throughout our collection of hotels and resorts. Contemporary amenities and timeless elegance — inspired by our unique destinations — are reflected throughout every Fairmont guest room. Features such as our Le Club AccorHotels recognition and preferences program, our Fairmont Gold exclusive lifestyle experience and our business centers are all ready for your convenience. <br>

Make Fairmont your personal gateway to exploring the world’s most extraordinary places—and to having your most memorable experiences.
